# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
(fill in your description and goals here)

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you found about the comparative quality of API coverage in your chosen area and the results of your model.)

## Challenges 
One challenge I encountered was the result limit and request limits for Foursquare requests. My model would be improved by including more categories of POIs. This model does not account for things like office spaces that might attract commuter traffic.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
